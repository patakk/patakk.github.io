Tell me when will you be mine
Tell me quando quando quando
We can share a love devine
Please don't make me wait again
When will you say yes to me
Tell me quando quando quando
You mean happiness to me
Oh my lover tell me when
Every moments a day
Every day seems a lifetime
Let me show you the way
To a joy beyond compare
I can't wait a moment more
Tell me quando quando quando
Say its me that you adore
And then darling tell me when
Every moments a day
Every day seems a lifetime
Let me show you the way
To a joy beyond compare
I can't wait a moment more
Tell me quando quando quando
Say its me that you adore
And then darling tell me when
Oh my darling tell me when
And then darling tell me when
Oh my darling tell me when
Ooh
